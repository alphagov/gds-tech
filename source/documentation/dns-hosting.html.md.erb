To make your services available over the internet they will need DNS records to let people know where they are.
`service.gov.uk` domains are delegated to [nameservers](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name#check-where-youll-host-your-dns) controlled by service teams.


## Principles

- DNS entry configuration should come from a version-controlled repository unless autogenerated
- Consider nameserver availability as part of your overall service availability


## Recommendations

- Use [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53)
- If you want more availability for your nameservers, use [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/) or [Dyn](https://dyn.com)
- Use a tool such as [govuk-dns](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-dns) or [octodns](https://github.com/github/octodns) to version control and publish your records if you need to
