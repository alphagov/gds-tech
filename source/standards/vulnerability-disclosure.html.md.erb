## Vulnerability Disclosure

In the Cabinet Office, including GDS, the [CDIO Cyber Security team] run a
vulnerability disclosure programme with [HackerOne] and [NCC Group] to triage
reports from security researchers.

This is not a sign post for security researchers to 'hack' our systems; we want
to advocate secure disclosure so we can find out about issues and fix them
before they cause a security incident.

GOV.UK hosts the security policy:
<https://www.gov.uk/help/report-vulnerability>

## security.txt
A `security.txt` file is a way of telling researchers how to get in contact with
us. As per the current policy, we only accept reports from services that have a
`security.txt` file pointing to the [security policy].

We have a central deployment of the `security.txt` file so that we only have to
keep one place up to date. The public [alphagov/security.txt] repo is where
it's maintained.

You should use <https://vdp.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/.well-known/security.txt>
in either:

- the origin for your site's `/.well-known/security.txt`
- the destination of a 302 redirect for `/.well-known/security.txt`

As well as `/.well-known/security.txt` you may optionally configure
`/security.txt`.

We do not recommend hosting the security.txt file yourself, but if you are
hosting it yourself, you should host at `/.well-known/security.txt` and
optionally `/security.txt`. You should use a `text/plain` content type and
follow the [current security.txt guidance].

## thanks.txt
The central `security.txt` file contains an acknowledgements page, which is used
for thanking researchers for valid reports. The page is a simple text file and
is hosted at: <https://vdp.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/thanks.txt>

The `thanks.txt` file is also maintained in the [alphagov/security.txt] repo.

If your vulnerability report comes through from the [CDIO Cyber Security team],
the team will engage with the researcher and ask if they would like to be added
to the page.

If you receive and manage a report directly and want to acknowledge a
researcher, check with them first and ask which name they wish to have
displayed.
