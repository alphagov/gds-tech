## Availability monitoring

[Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/) is the tool we've used most for availability
monitoring. If you need to monitor a service from outside the US or EU,
GOV.UK has used [CA App Synthetic Monitor](https://asm.ca.com/en/).

## Smoke tests

Teams should run regular smoke tests to ensure that services are available.
Several teams at GDS have used [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) for this.

## User journeys

Teams should use a tool to ensure user journeys are working as expected.

## Metrics-based monitoring

Metrics-based monitoring is useful - it works with virtual machines,
PaaS and containers. Collecting metrics is useful for capacity planning and
autoscaling.

## Metrics dashboards

Use [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) for creating dashboards to view
infrastructure and application metrics.

## Application error monitoring

Multiple teams at GDS are using or evaluating [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)
for application error monitoring.

## Configuration management

Teams should use configuration management to set up monitoring
reproducibly.
