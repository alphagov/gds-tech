If your web application is running on [GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS)][] you should follow the [recommended hosting guidance][].

If your web application is running on PaaS you should use:

* [Cloud Foundry Buildpacks][] to [build and deploy images][], as they’re widely used across GDS and industry
* [Dockerhub][] or [Amazon EC2 Container Registry][] to host your images following the [PaaS responsibility model][]
* the recommended [monitoring and logging solution][]

You can also run your service using bare metal Docker on an [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)][] instance if:

* service uptime is not a priority
* zero downtime deployments are not required
* it can be managed by configuration management

You cannot run:

* local images on the PaaS, as [deploying bare metal containers][] is not supported
* Docker containers with root access using the Docker daemon as this has [security implications][]

If your service requires high-availability, you should use the [Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)][] as your container orchestration service. By using [Amazon ECS clustering][] you can protect against unhealthy instances, and balance service workload across corresponding healthy instances.

If your application is either not currently running on PaaS, or it’s not possible to use PaaS as a platform due to technical constraints, you should...

If you are running a development environment using containers then you should…
