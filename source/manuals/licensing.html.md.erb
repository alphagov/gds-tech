## Guidelines for repositories containing code

### Each repository should include a licence file

This should be called `LICENCE` or `LICENCE.md`. "License" is the U.S. English spelling.

GitHub.com will still show licence details for the British English spelling.

You should specify the licence and link to it in the repository’s README. It’s typical to include this information at the very end of a README under a ‘Licence’ heading.

### Use MIT

At GDS we use the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Make sure the licence content is included in full, including the title "The MIT License", so that readers are quickly able to see what licence is being used.

### Copyright notice

The Copyright is Crown Copyright; you can put "Government Digital Service" in brackets.

e.g. `Copyright (c) 2018 Crown Copyright (Government Digital Service)`.

The year should be the year the code was first published. Where the code is continually updated with significant changes, the year can be shown as a period from first to most recent update (e.g. 2015-2018).

For more information on copyright notices, see the [UK Copyright Service fact sheet](http://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p03_copyright_notices).

### Example

There is a good example of a licence in the [pay-adminusers](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-adminusers/blob/master/LICENCE) repo.

## Guidelines for repositories that are open documentation

Some repositories will produce websites serving documentation. The GDS Way is an example of this. In addition to the MIT license for the code in the repository, you should include the [Open Government Licence (OGL)](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) for the documentation.

### Example

The [GDS Way](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-way) repo is a good example of licensing open documentation.
